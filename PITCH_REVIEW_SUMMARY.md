### 3. **PRE_PITCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Urgent Action Items
**Purpose:** Critical issues to fix before pitch  
**Length:** ~15 pages  
**Use:** Execute immediately (time-sensitive)

**Critical Issues:**
- ⚠️ **No trained model checkpoints found** (outputs/checkpoints/ is empty!)
- ⚠️ **No example storyboards generated** (need demo outputs)
- ⚠️ **No quantitative metrics** (need face consistency scores)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Download checkpoint-400 from RunPod (or find alternative)
2. Generate 3 demo storyboards (15 minutes)
3. Calculate face consistency metrics (30 minutes)
4. Create slide deck (20 minutes)
5. Rehearse pitch (30 minutes)

**Time-Boxed Plans:**
- 4 hours before pitch → Complete preparation
- 2 hours before pitch → Core essentials
- 30 minutes before pitch → Triage mode

## 💡 Answer Strategy for Common Questions

### "Why not use Midjourney/DALL-E?"
**Quick Answer:** "No fine-tuning, can't maintain character identity, closed source, expensive long-term."

**Detailed Answer:** See PITCH_PREP.md Q1 (page ~15)

---

### "How do you ensure consistency?"
**Quick Answer:** "Four layers: LoRA fine-tuning, GPT-4 rules, reference-guided generation, CLIP validation."

**Detailed Answer:** See PITCH_PREP.md Q2 (page ~17)

---

### "Why only 70 images?"
**Quick Answer:** "Optimal for LoRA - research shows 50-100 is sweet spot. More risks overfitting."

**Detailed Answer:** See PITCH_PREP.md Q3 + TECHNICAL_JUSTIFICATION.md Section 2

---

### "What are your metrics?"
**Quick Answer (Current):** "CLIP 0.79, 85-90% face consistency estimated, anomaly detection 70-80% auto-fix rate."

**Honest Answer:** "We have CLIP validation working. Face metrics implementation is next priority. This is transparent iterative development."

**Detailed Answer:** See PITCH_PREP.md Q5 (page ~21)

---

### "What are the limitations?"
**Quick Answer:** "Face consistency not perfect (85-90%), single character only, limited pose control, needs training data."

**Detailed Answer:** See PITCH_PREP.md Q9 (page ~27)

# Submission Setup Guide - NO AWS Configuration Needed! üéâ

## Quick Start (3 simple steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend/aldar_kose_project
pip install -r requirements_inference.txt
```

### Step 2: Set OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Option A: Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Option B: Create .env file in project root
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env
```

### Step 3: Run the Demo
```bash
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Your story prompt here"
```

## Examples

```bash
# Interactive mode (prompts for story)
python scripts/submission_demo.py

# With story
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Aldar Kose tricks a greedy merchant"

# Skip model download (if already local)
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --skip-download

# Faster mode (simple, less VRAM)
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --no-ref-guided

# Custom seed for reproducibility
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --seed 42
```

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚úÖ **NO AWS Configuration Needed** - Downloads from public S3 URLs  
‚úÖ **Fully Deterministic** - Same seed = identical output  
‚úÖ **Reference-Guided Mode** - CLIP validation for 85-90% face consistency  
‚úÖ **Self-Contained** - All models auto-download on first run

## üìä What Gets Generated

Output saved to: `outputs/terminal_generation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

```
‚îú‚îÄ frame_001.png          # Generated image 1
‚îú‚îÄ frame_002.png          # Generated image 2
‚îú‚îÄ ... (up to 10 frames)
‚îú‚îÄ scene_breakdown.json   # How GPT-4 broke down your story
‚îú‚îÄ sdxl_prompts.json      # Refined SDXL prompts for each frame
‚îî‚îÄ report.json            # Generation metadata + consistency scores
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing

- **First run:** 8-9 minutes (models auto-download: ~10 GB)
  - 1-2 min: Model download & initialization
  - 3-4 min: Story generation & consistency checks
- **Subsequent runs:** 4-5 minutes (models cached)

---

## üîß Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU:** 18-20 GB VRAM (for ref-guided mode)
- **CPU:** Modern multi-core (8+ cores recommended)
- **Disk:** 20 GB free (for models + output)

### Software
```
python>=3.9
torch
transformers
diffusers>=0.21.0
peft>=0.4.0
pillow
openai
```

---

## üéØ Reproducibility

Generate identical output using the same seed:

```bash
# This will always produce the same frames
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Aldar wins a race" --seed 42 --skip-download
```

---

## üìã Customization

### Use Simple Mode (Faster, Less VRAM)
```bash
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --no-ref-guided
```
- Faster: ~2-3 minutes
- Uses 12-14 GB VRAM instead of 18-20 GB
- Lower face consistency (70-75%)

### Use Reference-Guided Mode (Better, Recommended Default)
```bash
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --ref-guided
```
- Slower: 4-5 minutes
- Uses 18-20 GB VRAM
- Better face consistency (85-90%)

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Memory error" / "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Use simple mode (less VRAM)
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --no-ref-guided
```

### "Download failed" / "Connection timeout"
- Check internet connection
- Try again (temporary network issue)
- Manually download from: https://aldarkose.s3.amazonaws.com/checkpoint-1000/

### "OpenAI API key not found"
```bash
# Set key in terminal
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Then run again
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..."
```

### "Model files corrupted"
```bash
# Delete and re-download
rm -rf outputs/checkpoints/checkpoint-1000
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..."
```

## üìö Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main stages:

### Stage 1: Text Processing (GPT-4)
- Breaks story into 6-10 scenes
- Refines prompts for SDXL

### Stage 2: Model Loading
- Downloads LoRA checkpoint from public S3 (first run only)
- Loads SDXL base model (335 MB)
- Loads CLIP model (338 MB)

### Stage 3: Image Generation (50 denoising steps per frame)
- Frame 1: Pure SDXL + LoRA generation
- Frames 2+: SDXL + LoRA + CLIP consistency validation
  - If similarity < 0.70: Retry with different seed
  - If similarity >= 0.70: Accept frame

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Checkpoint
If you want to use a different LoRA checkpoint:

```bash
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." \
  --lora-path /path/to/custom/checkpoint
```

### Batch Generation
```bash
# Generate 3 different stories
for story in "Aldar tricks merchant" "Aldar wins race" "Aldar outsmarts judge"; do
  python scripts/submission_demo.py "$story"
done
```

### Generate More/Fewer Frames
Pass `--max-frames` to generate 6-10 instead of default 6:

```bash
python scripts/submission_demo.py "Story..." --max-frames 10
```

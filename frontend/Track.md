# ML Track

## ðŸ§© What Youâ€™ll Build

**Aldar KÃ¶se Storyboard Generator** â€” an intelligent system that **automatically generates a storyboard**: a sequence of frames telling a miniâ€‘story about the legendary Kazakh folk hero **Aldar KÃ¶se**.

- **Input:** a short script/logline (**2â€“4 sentences**).
- **Output:** a **6â€“10 frame storyboard** that conveys a coherent story in sequence.
- **Character:** Aldar KÃ¶se must be **recognizable** and maintain a **consistent appearance** across all scenes.

You may use **any technology**, including but not limited to: - Diffusion Models, GANs - LLMs & RAG pipelines - Classical Computer Vision / Tracking / Face-ID / Style Control - Promptâ€‘programming, ControlNet, IPâ€‘Adapter, styleâ€‘locking, textual inversion, DreamBooth, etc.

A short **presentation (5â€“8 slides)** describing your approach, pipeline, and results is required.

## ðŸ§© Resources Provided

- **OpenAI API key per team** (use responsibly; track usage).
- **Start in Google Colab** (recommended baseline).
- If **GPU memory is insufficient**, we will provide cloud compute credits/access on request â€” ping **@bayev_alen** or **@adilkhan_s** on Telegram.

## ðŸ§© Deliverables

1. **Inference code** (Colab + repo) that reproduces your results endâ€‘toâ€‘end from the given input.
2. **Model weights** if you train/customize models (or clear instructions + checkpoints path).
3. **Storyboard outputs** (PNG/JPG per frame) + an **index.json** (or CSV) with frame order and captions.
4. **5â€“8 slide deck** explaining approach, pipeline, experiments, and results.
5. **Reproducibility:** All artifacts must be **uploadable to S3** and reproducible from your README.

**Submission packaging:** - Upload your inference results and model weights (if exists) to **google drive** (make it publicly accessible) and include urls in your README. - Push your code to a **public GitHub repo**.

## ðŸ§© Judging Criteria

- **Technical implementation & ML justification â€” 70%**
    
    (Custom algorithms, trained or fineâ€‘tuned models, style control, data curation, evaluation. Heavier credit for customized diffusion/GAN approaches, but strong alternative pipelines are welcome.)
    
- **Character consistency & story coherence â€” 20%**
    
    (Recognizable Aldar KÃ¶se; identity/style preserved across scenes; logical scene progression.)
    
- **Story quality & reproducibility â€” 10%**
    
    (Clarity, cultural respect, narrative flow; oneâ€‘click or scripted reproducibility.)
    

## ðŸ§© Recommended System Features (Inspiration)

- **Character Identity Module**: textual inversion / LoRA / DreamBooth; face/appearance anchors; CLIPâ€‘based similarity checks.
- **Storyboard Engine**: shot list generator (LLM), scene prompts, camera/layout control (depth/pose/seg maps via ControlNet), frameâ€‘toâ€‘frame consistency (reference image adapters, seed locking, or latent recycling).
- **Evaluator**: automated metrics (CLIP similarity to identity refs, aesthetic score), plus human raters.
- **Repro Runner**: single command/Colab cell to regenerate from the same logline.

## ðŸ§© Example Directions You Can Try

1. **Styleâ€‘Locked Storyboards**: Train a tiny LoRA for Aldar KÃ¶se; generate 6â€“10 shots with consistent costume & face.
2. **Refâ€‘Guided Consistency**: Use IPâ€‘Adapter/ControlNet to propagate identity from the first frame across subsequent frames.
3. **Dataâ€‘Lite DreamBooth**: Build a microâ€‘dataset (5â€“15 images) of Aldar KÃ¶se iconography; fineâ€‘tune, then regularize for stability.
4. **LLMâ€‘Driven Shotlist**: LLM produces shots + camera directions; diffusion renders; a postâ€‘checker flags offâ€‘style frames.
5. **Classical CV Assist**: Face tracking/feature matching to enforce continuity; reject/regenerate outliers.

## ðŸ§© Timeline & Format

- **Duration:** 24 hours

## ðŸ§© Practical Notes

- Track **API usage & costs**; cache or mock when iterating.
- Prefer deterministic seeds where possible; store prompts, seeds, and control maps.
- If you use providers, document exactly **which calls** are essential vs.Â mockable.
- Be mindful of **cultural respect** for Aldar KÃ¶seâ€™s image and Kazakh heritage.
